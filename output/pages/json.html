This is an increase from 3.4 billion people last year, and the number of users is projected to grow even further in the coming years. After all, digital technologies are expected to become more available and accessible in less developed countries over time. By extension, the number of social media users will also increase. There are many social media applications including, but not limited to, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat. FIX CHART Globally, governments are instituting varied forms of legislation to counter the potential issues which accompany the proliferation of social media. This is unsurprising given that social media has the power to influence societal norms and behaviours. It could even be argued that social media facilitates co-production. Due to the large reach and influence of social media, it is able to alter and shape identities, institutions, discourses and representations. Therefore, the impact which social media has on society\u2019s conception of food and nutrition is worth analysing. Celebrity Endorsement versus Expert Advice With followers and fans amounting to millions, celebrities and celebrity influencers have an unprecedented amount of influence on people. Due to their fame, celebrities are often perceived as reliable \u201cauthority\u201d. Consequently, celebrity endorsements which contradict expert advice on issues, including food and nutrition, have detrimental effects which are hard to quantify. An apt example would be Kim Kardashian\u2019s advertisement for appetite suppressant lollipops in May 2018. The Instagram post, as shown below, garnered much backlash before eventually being deleted. . Critics argue that Kim was promoting an unhealthy and toxic culture. According to nutrition editor Cynthia Sass, \u201cwe need healthier relationships with food and our bodies\u201d. Suppressing one\u2019s appetite is definitely not the right approach to achieving weight loss or health. This highlights a tension between celebrities and experts. While many celebrities benefit from an accelerated growth in the beauty and diet industries, many health experts are struggling as fake news and pseudo-facts are becoming indistinguishable from reliable information. Kim Kardiashian is not the only celebrity guilty of endorsing scientifically questionable products. Teami, a detox tea company that sells various products which allegedly contain health benefits, have been promoted by well-known celebrities including Kylie Jenner, Cardi B and Demi Lovato. Despite having large followings on social media, these celebrities clearly prioritize their personal commercial interests over tangible health implications. In March 2020, Teami was made to pay $15 million by the US Federal Trade Commission for \u201cmaking unsubstantiated claims about their products and promoted those claims using paid influencers\u201d. Moreover, experts have warned that excessive or regular consumption of detox teas could damage one\u2019s gut lining, or cause nutrient depletion. There is clearly a conflict between celebrity endorsements and expert advice. Unfortunately, social media has contributed to the conflict by catapulting celebrities to an unrivalled status, in terms of fame and influence. Unrealistic Notion of Beauty Embed the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BlvUnysREo\u0026ab_channel=SAYS Social media applications have transformed into a platform which promotes an unrealistic and unhealthy notion of beauty. As highlighted previously, celebrities and influencers profit off others\u2019 self-image insecurities. They routinely go against evidence-based discourse on food and nutrition advocated by experts, choosing instead to promote unreliable health and wellness products. Research has shown that social media usage results in body image concerns amongst both women and men. This can be corroborated by many experts and is an unsurprising finding. After all, social media exposes users to an \u2018ideal\u2019 body type which is often very unrealistic and hard to attain. More often than not, the celebrities and influencers possessing such body types achieve those as a result of routine cosmetic surgeries, expensive diet programmes and even excessive photo editing. In fact, this reasoning forms the basis of Jameela Jamil\u2019s April 2019 criticism of Khloe Kardashian\u2019s Instagram post advertising Flat Tummy shakes. In short, an inclusive culture that promotes a healthy concept of food and nutrition is not commonly found in social media platforms. Despite increased efforts by advocates to counter the negative effects which social media has on individuals\u2019 self-image and body image, the overwhelming narrative is still toxic and unhealthy."
