The Calorie Concept is based upon the first law of thermodynamics which is the conservation of energy in an isolated system

<span class="marginnote">
As alluded to in my introduction, from the lens of co-production, the caloric concept and the food pyramid were really the first sites of stabilisation, or in Thomas Kuhn&rsquo;s language, a paradigm about food science. 
</span> The idea is that in order to lose weight, a negative caloric balance or caloric deficit is necessary. In a caloric deficit, the body is forced to use energy stored in the body in the form of glycogen and fat and in doing so, weight would be reduced. [1] This is an intuitive way to look at nutrition and is how it is often communicated to, referenced and internalised by the public. The public&rsquo;s view is that an easy way of losing weight is to eat less, without understanding the nuances of calorie counting and food nutrition.</p>
<p>That public discourse stabilizes this naive concept of food nutrition, as opposed to scientists&rsquo; closer engagement with nature, is dangerous. It is a misunderstanding that total calorie intake is the be-all and end-all of nutrition. In fact, having the right mixture of nutrients and foods plays as large a part in the physical constitution of our body - our physical self! [2]</p>
<h2 id="food pyramid">Food pyramid</h2>
<p>The food pyramid further represents such a stabilised public understanding about balanced diet and nutrition. The first food pyramid was created in Sweden during the 1970s when food prices were high. It was meant to show people how to obtain adequate nutrition at affordable prices. Then, Anna Britt Agns&auml;ter came up with the idea of a triangular diagram to better portray the recommended amounts for each food type. The idea was that there were basic foods which were cheap and nutritious and there were supplementary foods which provided nutrients missing from the basic foods. [3] At least for the public&rsquo;s understanding of food science, it  <label class="margin-toggle" for="mn-note">
is clear that the Food Pyramid was never a purely scientific instrument, taking into account local societal conditions in the economy and food supply.

<span class="marginnote">
However, the most well-known version was published by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1992.

</span></p>
<p>The food pyramid recommends food intake based on research on nutrition balance and daily caloric intake. Further, insofar as nutritional science engages in observational studies of the public&rsquo;s eating patterns, it is interesting from the lens of co-production that the public&rsquo;s behaviour is based on the food pyramid. The message from internalising the food pyramid is that a healthy caloric intake consists of different foods of different nutrient profiles. In comparison to relying purely on the calorie concept, the food pyramid provides a much more holistic approach and would be more effective overall in encouraging healthy living. </p>
<p>That is not to say the food pyramid created by the USDA is without flaws. A peculiar fact about the 1992 USDA food pyramid is that it has a section dedicated purely to dairy products. The implied message is that dairy products are an essential part of a healthy diet. Yet, humans do not need dairy in their diets. [4] In fact, 68% of the world population have reduced ability to digest lactose, the predominant sugar in milk. [5] Some have speculated that the USDA were subject to pressures from the food industry to include dairy in the pyramid. Powerful and influential actors supported the research of science that benefitted them. A further instance which shows that the food pyramid doesn&rsquo;t necessarily advance the best scientific advice is that there is a difference between modern and traditional diets, in which foods are more than their constituent ingredients or even nutrients, and this is a complex question showing how processed foods might are worse off than a good traditional (e.g. Mediterranean) meal. </p>
<p>Phew! Thanks for reading that. There&rsquo;s always more to learn on both sides of how society affects an ideal study of food science: after all, most food scientists have the public&rsquo;s best interests at heart. I&rsquo;ll discuss this further in my next post about our experimentations with vegetarianism! </p>
