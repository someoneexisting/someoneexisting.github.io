# What is citizen science?
Citizen science is a popularised term that describes a family of different participatory modes in which amateurs, without necessarily a formal training in science, contribute to the production of scientific knowledge (“with education as an associated goal or a by-product”). [3] Further, there are different types of citizen science such as simple data gathering to extreme forms of citizen science which may include self-experimentation. [4] 

In today’s post, I would like to discuss how around the globe, the vegetarianism and vegan movement has become more popular. Many individuals are leaning towards plant-based diets due to general health reasons, stemming from concerns over health risk from consuming meat, as well as environmental reasons such as a concern with the environmental degradation associated with the meat industry. In this entry, we focus on vegetarian’s concerns about health, as that is the interface between food science and social actors.

## Popularity of veganism
In 2009, veganism only had a popularity score of 20 in Google’s worldwide search interest ranking. Over the years, veganism’s popularity greatly increased. In 2019, for instance, the popularity score of veganism rose up to 65 in Google’s worldwide search interest ranking. This increased popularity can be attributed to the increased amount of health issues arising from the high levels of consumption of processed foods and red meat over the years.

## Risk in red meat
Consuming red meat would possess higher risk of potential heart disease. According to research from Oxford Academic, people that consume red meat on a regular basis will have a higher level of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). [1] According to a paper in the European Heart Journal, “trimethylamine N-oxide is a gut microbiota-generated metabolite with mechanistic links to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic heart disease”. [2] Compared to vegans, red meat eaters have three times the amount of TMAO. [2] This revelation plays a role in triggering some people’s change towards plant-based only diets to reduce the risk of potential heart diseases. 

It is most interesting for our concerns about vegetarianism and citizen science, is that nutritional facts can often be weaponized against polemic enemies, presumably of the opposing diet type. These studies cited by users on these internet forums can range from actual academic papers, or data sets accrued by users on an internet forum. We then question, like Bruno Latour, if these citations are actually properly read and their claims contain a legitimate connection to the scientific actor-network. For instance, a common scientific concern is that vegans can’t get enough vitamin B12, and it might be suggested aggressively or out of concern that vegans ought to eat eggs as well. A view that arguments among citizen scientists parallels disputes among scientists, and their lack of resolution, is interesting, as perhaps it goes in some way to explaining why these problems do not have closure: on a factual, then social level. 

## Food industry
Regardless of the tractability of debates about health for or against vegetarianism, the food industry is increasingly positioned to profit from it. Globally, popular fast-food restaurants are aware of the rising trend towards plant-based eating diets. The effects are also evident in Singapore. One prominent example would be McDonald’s release of its first ever veggie burger back in September 2016. The ‘veggie crunch burger’ was meant to cater to vegans and also individuals opting for a healthier food choice. Such a move to cater to interests in vegetarianism has never been done before on my island state.

Singapore’s Burger King outlets also followed McDonald’s footstep. In March 2019, Burger King released a veggie burger and is made available in all Burger King outlets in the country. It was widely advertised on many avenues, including the company’s official Facebook page.

Furthermore, food chains such as Impossible Food have started researching plant-based meat for vegans to experience meat-like taste. This is made possible by an advancing food science with more interests in vegetarianism as a legitimate issue of science and increased funding from societal interest.

## Findings
The scientific research on the risk of processed/red meat led to a change in food preference among the citizens to form a vegan movement. It is interesting then, that the shift into vegetarianism out of a concern for red meat, has led to McDonald’s or Burger King’s coalition with vegetarianism, since these processed foods are clearly just as unhealthy, and eating a McDonald’s veggie burger is more of a social signal than a good nutritional source.  

Further, we have seen that there is an increased stabilisation and interest in food science for vegetarianism as a better health and economical alternative. The changes in society have led scientists to develop/innovate plant-based meat for the vegans which can be seen from Impossible Foods. From my understanding from the co-production’s lens, these dietary battles by scientific and citizen actors will go on for quite a while!
