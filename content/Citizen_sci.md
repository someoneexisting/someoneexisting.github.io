# What is citizen science?
Citizen science refers to non-scientists individuals playing a role in developing a new culture. One of the food cultures that were born through citizen science is vegetarianism. Around the globe, the vegetarianism and vegan movement is becoming more popular. Many individuals are starting to lean towards plant-based only diets due to general health reasons, concerns over health risk from consuming meat and environmental factors.

## Popularity of veganism
In 2009, veganism only had a popularity score of 20 in Google’s worldwide search interest ranking. Over the years, veganism’s popularity greatly increased. In 2019, for instance, the popularity score of veganism rose up to 65 in Google’s worldwide search interest ranking. This increased popularity can be attributed to the increased amount of health issues arising from the high levels of consumption of processed foods and red meat over the years.

### Risk in red meat
Consuming red meat would possess higher risk of potential heart disease [1]. According to research from Oxford Academic, people that consume red meat on a regular basis will have a higher level of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) [1]. “Trimethylamine N-oxide is a gut microbiota-generated metabolite with mechanistic links to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic heart disease” [2]. Compared to vegans, red meat eaters have three times the amount of TMAO [1]. This revelation plays a role in triggering some people’s change towards plant-based only diets to reduce the risk of potential heart diseases.


### Food industry
Globally, popular fast-food restaurants are aware of the rising trend towards plant-based eating diets. The effects are also evident in Singapore. One prominent example would be McDonald’s release of its first ever veggie burger back in September 2016. The ‘veggie crunch burger’ was meant to cater to vegans and also individuals opting for a healthier food choice. Such a vegetarian-based move has never been done before.

Singapore’s Burger King outlets also followed McDonald’s footstep. In March 2019, Burger King released a veggie burger and is made available in all Burger King outlets in the country. It was widely advertised on many avenues, including the company’s official Facebook page.

Food chains such as Impossible Food have started researching plant-based meat for vegans to experience meat-like taste. This is made possible by combining science with plants. 


## Findings
The scientific research on the risk of processed/red meat led to a change in food preference among the citizens to form a vegan movement. The changes among the society led scientists to develop/innovate plant-based meat for the vegans which can be seen from Impossible Foods. Clearly, there is a co-production from science to society and back to science.
