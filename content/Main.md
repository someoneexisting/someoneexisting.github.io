There is one thing that bugs me every day: what is the distance between societal discourse about food and food science as I learn academically in school? This is an object of analysis that occupies my mind day and night: from the 
[very definition of health through the food pyramid](/the-calorie-concept-and-the-health-pyramid.html), to our personal struggles with diet embedded with the science world via [explorations of alternative diets](citizen-science-and-veganism.html)
, [mental health](food-nutrition-mental-health.html) or [beauty](/beauty-in-the-age-of-social-media.html). 

Sheila Jasanoff is a seminal thinker in STS who helped formulate the lens of co-production. Co-production is an idiom of analysis which focuses on the dynamic in which the social and the scientific worlds co-interact and constitute one another. In my writings here, I want to capture the sense in which food science, and its public-facing discourse that has been explicitly shaped by government or industry-sponsored pressures, is continually part of the ordering and reordering of society. Further, rather than focusing on <label for="mn-note" class="margin-toggle">
prescribing competing interests to government or industrial forces
</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-note" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
And thereby give primacy to sociological forces in resolving controversies in science, as my Health Communication courses regularly do. 
</span>, the theory of co-production instead focuses on specific issues and the reinscribing boundaries between the social and natural worlds. 

This is what I set out to do as I focus on the difference between an academic food science and food science as the public encounters it. I believe it will be an enlightening experience for all of us. Please leave your comments or talk to me when you see me in school!
