## Social Media and its Influence
As we are now living in the age of social media, the effect of social media usage on our perception of health and beauty is immense. As of January 2020, approximately 3.6 billion people use social media applications globally. [1] The number of users is projected to grow even further in the coming years! As you can see from the graph below, the most popular social networks garner millions and even billions of users. [2] Isn’t that impressive?

With social media’s extensive reach and influence, it is easy to see why social media has become a platform for negotiating between scientific and societal notions of beauty. Individuals are able to easily leverage on social media to alter and shape identities, discourses and representations. Is there a perfect body type? Would it sensible to achieve this ideal and is it made possible by science? The impact of social media on society’s conception of food and nutrition is worth analysing. 


## Celebrity Endorsement versus Expert Advice 
With followers and fans amounting to millions on social media applications, celebrities and influencers have an unprecedented amount of influence on people. Moreover, celebrities are often perceived as reliable “authority”. [3] Consequently, celebrity endorsements which contradict expert advice on important matters - including food and nutrition - have detrimental effects which are hard to quantify. 

An apt example would be Kim Kardashian’s advertisement for appetite suppressant lollipops in May 2018. The Instagram post, as shown below, garnered much backlash before eventually being deleted. [4].

Health experts and nutritionists critiqued Kardashian for promoting an unhealthy and toxic culture. According to nutrition editor Cynthia Sass, “we need healthier relationships with food and our bodies”. [5] Suppressing one’s appetite is definitely not the right approach to achieving weight loss or health. This highlights a tension between celebrities and experts. While many celebrities benefit from an unprecedented growth in the beauty and diet industries, many health experts are struggling to keep up as fake news is becoming indistinguishable from reliable information. [6] As a budding food scientist myself, I concur with critiques on this matter. 

Kardashian is not the only celebrity guilty of endorsing scientifically questionable products. <label for="mn-note" class="margin-toggle">Teami, a detox company, have been promoted by well-known celebrities including Kylie Jenner, Cardi B and Demi Lovato. [7]

Teami made a post regarding Kylie Jenner and Cardi B’s endorsements which can be found on the following link: [https://www.teamiblends.com/blogs/lifestyle/kylie-jenner-and-cardi-b-endorse-teami](https://www.teamiblends.com/blogs/lifestyle/kylie-jenner-and-cardi-b-endorse-teami)</span>

These celebrities are willing to advertise shady products for the sake of commercial interests. Experts have long warned against detox teas as it could damage one’s gut lining or cause nutrient depletion. [8] This turned out to have legal ramifications. In March 2020, Teami was charged \$15 million by the US Federal Trade Commission for “making unsubstantiated claims about their products and promoted those claims using paid influencers”. [9] Once again, we see a conflict between celebrity endorsements and expert advice. Yet, the sheer influence of celebrities means that a potentially large number of individuals could be following toxic and unhealthy methods in hopes of becoming more like these celebrities. 

## Unrealistic Notion of Beauty

Research has shown that social media usage results in body image concerns amongst both women and men. [11] This is expected as social media platforms expose users to an ‘ideal’ body type which is often unrealistic and impossible to attain. Even celebrities and influencers resort to routine cosmetic surgeries, excessive diet programmes, strict gym routines and excessive photo editing to achieve the ‘desirable’ body. This argument forms the basis of Jameela Jamil’s criticism of Khloe Kardashian’s Instagram post advertising Flat Tummy shakes. [12]

In short, an inclusive culture that promotes a healthy concept of food and nutrition is not commonly found in social media platforms. Despite increased efforts by advocates to counter the negative effects which social media has on individuals’ self-image and body image, the overwhelming narrative is still toxic and unhealthy. 


In short, social media platforms have grown to be a site of contestation between well-informed (and often well-intentioned) health experts and corporate-funded celebrities on what constitutes ‘health’ and ‘beauty’. There has also been increased efforts to counter the negative effects which social media usage has on individuals’ self-image and body image. Yet, the overwhelming narrative remains toxic and detrimental in the long-run. Worst, it seems impossible to tease the scientific from the social, and it is best for us to continue critically examining the ‘beautiful’ that bridges the two worlds.
