# The Calorie Concept
*The calorie is a unit of measurement for energy. There are two broad definitions of calorie: small calorie and large calorie. The large calorie is generally associated with food and nutrition, so this will be the calorie referred to henceforth. A calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature in one kilogram of water by one kelvin. 

The Calorie Concept is based upon the first law of thermodynamics which is the conservation of energy in an isolated system. It attributes weight gain to a net gain of calories which means that calorie intake is higher than calories expended. It can also be interpreted as eating too much, exercising too little or a combination of both. The idea is that in order to lose weight, a negative caloric balance or caloric deficit is necessary. In a caloric deficit, the body is forced to use energy stored in the body in the form of glycogen and fat and in doing so weight would be reduced.[1] This is an intuitive way to look at nutrition and is therefore referenced and used often by the public.

However, this way of looking at food and nutrition may lead to a misunderstanding that total calorie intake is the be-all and end-all of nutrition. When in fact, having the right mixture of nutrients and where these nutrients come from is an important aspect of nutrition as well.[2] Fats are extremely calorie dense and satisfaction of caloric requirements can technically be accomplished through consumption of fat alone, but that would certainly cause harm to a human body. Nutrients such as vitamins, carbohydrates, minerals and many more are essential for survival and cannot be accounted for solely through calorie counting. Calorie counting is also inaccurate due to difficulty in accounting for every factor such as calories burnt from sedentary activities, energy used in metabolism and breaking down of food and basal metabolism.

(Black box of losing weight through calorie counting. Weight loss categorised into two phases, early phase: “relatively large glycogen, protein, and fluid losses”, late phase: “high proportion of fat loss”. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810417](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810417/), without understanding the inner workings of the blackbox, society only cared about the output, ended up with weight loss without loss in fats, leading to short term weight loss.)*

## Food pyramid
In a discussion about balanced diets and nutrition, one cannot not bring up the food pyramid. The first food pyramid was created in Sweden during the 1970s when food prices were high and the food pyramid was supposed to show how to obtain adequate nutrition at affordable prices. Then, Anna Britt Agnsäter came up with the idea of a triangular diagram to better portray the recommended amounts for each food type. The idea was that there were basic foods which were cheap and nutritious and supplementary foods which provided nutrients missing from the basic foods.[3] However, that version is likely not the one familiar with most people. The most well known version was published by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1992.

The food pyramid recommends food intake based on research on nutrition balance and daily caloric intake. This is a case where the needs of society gave rise to an increase in interest and funding of research into food and nutrition. This guide encourages a healthy caloric intake with sources of necessary nutrients in the diet. In comparison to relying purely on the calorie concept, the food pyramid provides a much more holistic approach and would be more effective overall in encouraging healthy living. 

That is not to say the food pyramid created by the USDA is without flaws. A peculiar fact about the 1992 USDA food pyramid is that it has a section dedicated purely to dairy products. The implied message is that dairy products are part of a healthy diet. Yet, humans do not need dairy in their diets.[4] In fact, 68% of the world population have reduced ability to digest lactose, the predominant sugar in milk.[5] Some have speculated that the USDA were subject to pressures from the food industry to include dairy in the pyramid. This is an instance where the effects of societal pressure can be observed in the field of science. Science has often been intertwined with society and in the case of the food pyramid, it is detrimentally so.
