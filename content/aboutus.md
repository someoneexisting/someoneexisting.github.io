My name is Amanda. I am a food scientist and I blog about social issues in my free time. This blog is about my own reconciliation with the concept of food. 

What is food? We might think it is reasonable to assume that in prehistoric times men simply ate, perhaps in startling patterns of irregularity between starvation and feast. 

When did men come to tame the world into the lavish, and then stiffing, prison of 3 meals a day, with <label for="mn-note" class="margin-toggle">
the caloric concept compelling her how much to eat?

a typical Singaporean woman would require approximately [1800 kcal a day](https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/70/7-day-dining-guide).

There are so many questions in food science that, if I were to be honest with you, cannot be understood with science alone. What is health? Is there a notion of fitness that is independent of gender, poverty lines? What about the dreams of a citizen's own democratic and free inquiry into this area of scientific interests, which I have spent so much of my life, only to have one paradigm overturned after another?

<label for="mn-note" class="margin-toggle">
For this reason, I present to you a piecemeal report of my understanding of food. Tell me then, does the food industry nourish us, or do we nourish the food industry more?

As any good scientist will warn you: I caution you against believing me naively. Any one in this world is biased in their own way. We resist against this by focusing on the theoretical lens of co-production: that is, the refusal to refuse social issues to science, nor the scientific issues to social determinism.
