"body": "In this part of the project, we discuss how nutrition is directly related to the issue of mental health , and how Jasanoff\u2019s idea of co-production, which suggests that knowledge is derived from the interactions of science and society, and that they are intrinsically tied to each other, can be applied to the scientific object of food and nutrition. Through the analysis of research carried out, we observe how food and nutrition, a necessity of society, directly affects our mental health processes, emphasizing the influence scientific research has on society. In scientific research made on the relations between nutrition and mental health, it has been determined that despite the genetical differences between members of society, food does indeed have a significant part to play in maintaining mental health, as consuming proper nutrition provides the required nutrients for all components of the nervous system, allowing for the body\u2019s optimal function (3). For example, consuming cruciferous vegetables rich in isothiocyanates would allow the body to optimize physiological functions like learning and memory, as it directly upregulates NRF-2, the gene transcription factor that manages these functions in the brain. However, the inverse is also true; if a subject\u2019s diet would contain toxicants which stress their nervous system, causing negative mental health results. One such example is observation of how the display of hyperactivity in children due to an increased consumption in artificial food dyes and preservatives. (3) Despite these facts, it has been observed that there has been a dramatic increase in sugar, trans fat and salt content in heavily processed food, to amplify flavour, and do not provide the required nutrients needed (2). Indeed, the constant consumption of these foods would lead to further mental health issues like anxiety or depression. This could be due to a few factors, one of which is the increased consumption of artificial sweeteners in heavily processed food. Our bodies are unable to deal with high doses of glucose/sugar, and sudden surges of insulin, which manages glucose levels in our bloodstream. As such, by exposing it to artificial sweeteners, such as High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), that possess high levels of sugar, our body would release adrenalin to try to manage this rise. Consequently, as adrenalin is an acute stress hormone, we would experience numerous mental issues such as anxiety and fatigue to the sudden rise of adrenalin levels (2). Similarly, it has been observed that an increased consumption in heavily processed food by children would result in mental issues such as stunted learning or behavioural problems, and that there was a higher chance of hyperactivity in children who have consumed these foods (3). Nevertheless, this begs the question: how do these scientific facts directly affect society? Simply put, it highlights the fact that heavily processed food is unhealthy for us, and should be avoided. In reality, however, it is much more difficult to do so, as there are multiple societal factors that affect the choices we make when purchasing and consuming food, emphasizing the importance of co-production, as we make these decisions despite having the knowledge of the disadvantages of consuming heavily processed food. One of the major influencers of our decisions is the factor of cost; the prices of heavily processed foods tend to be comparatively lower than fresh ones. Fresh food has to be sold at an increased cost due to their high perishability requiring more expensive storage. In comparison, heavily processed food can be easily produced at a higher rate, and are often subsidised by governments, leading to a lower cost and thus a cheaper price overall (4). Ironically, these subsidies are actually triggered by our decisions to favour cheap and convenient processed junk, leading to governments giving subsidies to those that produce this junk.(4) This calls into question: if we were to base our diets on scientific knowledge, and avoid heavily processed foods, would fresh food, which are currently sold at premiums, be more accessible? Sadly, this situation is currently unavoidable for certain members of society, and traps the underprivileged in a cycle of negative results. Due to a lack of funds, the poor are forced to consume cheaper foods which are heavily processed. However, these foods lack proper nutrients, and limit their ability to learn and work. These limitations would hamper their attempts to break out of the poverty cycle by causing mental issues, which result in them being unable to earn enough money to do so. These processed foods may even cause physical medical problems due to toxins which may be present in these foods, resulting in a further draining of funds. This process highlights the concept of co-production by showing how science permeates into certain sectors of society, and that science and society are not mutually exclusive. Generational Impact However, the effects of the lack of nutrition do not end there; research has shown that this lack of nutrition may have further repercussions, and might affect the offspring of the malnourished, making it even harder for families to break out of the poverty cycle. Evidence by a study focused on the effects prenatal nutrition has on adult mental health suggests that a lack of proper nutrition would result in an uptick in mental health issues in the population. The study focuses on how prenatal malnutrition (i.e. malnutrition of the parents) directly affects the probability of a child eventually developing mental issues such as schizophrenia later in their life, essentially underlining that nutrition is especially important when discussing the issue of mental health. (1) As displayed from the figures above, the study uses comparison of births versus probability of mental health issues developing to support their argument. The scientists observe that a lack of nutrition, which leads to a lower amount of birth, directly affect the mental health of subjects. The events that cause a lack of nutrition were caused by different societal issues, such as World War II for the Dutch example and the Great Leap Forward for the Chinese example, triggering famines, and a lack of births, due to food rationing limiting the amount of nutrition received by parents. (1) Consequently, the lack of nutrition would display an increase in the amount of patients with mental issues through prenatal malnutrition, further emphasizing the importance of co-production, as it highlights how societal issues directly affect scientific/medical ones, and vice versa. Conclusion Essentially, through research, it can be concluded that the effects of nutrition, or most importantly the lack of it, have a direct impact on both the physical and mental health of members of society. These results highlight the importance of using science to assess the effects objects, such as food, have on society, as it can reveal negative consequences hidden in these objects. Most importantly, it further cements Jasanoff\u2019s idea of co-production, as they display how science and society are intrinsically tied to each other, as the lack of proper nutrition, due to societal reasons such as poverty, may cost negative consequences, some of which may be long lasting.

"url": "citizen-science-on-their-own-diets-a-look-at-vegetarianism.html",
"body": "What is citizen science? Citizen science refers to non-scientists individuals playing a role in developing a new culture. One of the food cultures that were born through citizen science is vegetarianism. Around the globe, the vegetarianism and vegan movement is becoming more popular. Many individuals are starting to lean towards plant-based only diets due to general health reasons, concerns over health risk from consuming meat and environmental factors. https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102038/singapore-reasons-for-plant-based-diets/ Popularity of veganism In 2009, veganism only had a popularity score of 20 in Google\u2019s worldwide search interest ranking. Over the years, veganism\u2019s popularity greatly increased. In 2019, for instance, the popularity score of veganism rose up to 65 in Google\u2019s worldwide search interest ranking. This increased popularity can be attributed to the increased amount of health issues arising from the high levels of consumption of processed foods and red meat over the years. https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44488051 Risk in red meat Consuming red meat would possess higher risk of potential heart disease [1]. According to research from Oxford Academic, people that consume red meat on a regular basis will have a higher level of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) [1]. \u201cTrimethylamine N-oxide is a gut microbiota-generated metabolite with mechanistic links to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic heart disease\u201d [2]. Compared to vegans, red meat eaters have three times the amount of TMAO [1]. This revelation plays a role in triggering some people\u2019s change towards plant-based only diets to reduce the risk of potential heart diseases. Food industry Globally, popular fast-food restaurants are aware of the rising trend towards plant-based eating diets. The effects are also evident in Singapore. One prominent example would be McDonald\u2019s release of its first ever veggie burger back in September 2016. The \u2018veggie crunch burger\u2019 was meant to cater to vegans and also individuals opting for a healthier food choice. Such a vegetarian-based move has never been done before. https://www.travellingmcds.com/2017/05/veggie-crunch-burger-singapore-april.html Singapore\u2019s Burger King outlets also followed McDonald\u2019s footstep. In March 2019, Burger King released a veggie burger and is made available in all Burger King outlets in the country. It was widely advertised on many avenues, including the company\u2019s official Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/BurgerKingSG/photos/a.403938841773/10157092437906774/?type=3\u0026theater Food chains such as Impossible Food have started researching plant-based meat for vegans to experience meat-like taste. This is made possible by combining science with plants. Findings The scientific research on the risk of processed/red meat led to a change in food preference among the citizens to form a vegan movement. The changes among the society led scientists to develop/innovate plant-based meat for the vegans which can be seen from Impossible Foods. Clearly, there is a co-production from science to society and back to science. Reference [1] Is red meat bad for you? Benefits, risks, research, and guidelines: MedicalNewsToday [Online].

"title": "The Calorie Concept and the Health Pyramid",
"url": "the-calorie-concept-and-the-health-pyramid.html",
"body": "The Calorie Concept *The calorie is a unit of measurement for energy. There are two broad definitions of calorie: small calorie and large calorie. The large calorie is generally associated with food and nutrition, so this will be the calorie referred to henceforth. A calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature in one kilogram of water by one kelvin. The Calorie Concept is based upon the first law of thermodynamics which is the conservation of energy in an isolated system. It attributes weight gain to a net gain of calories which means that calorie intake is higher than calories expended. It can also be interpreted as eating too much, exercising too little or a combination of both. The idea is that in order to lose weight, a negative caloric balance or caloric deficit is necessary. In a caloric deficit, the body is forced to use energy stored in the body in the form of glycogen and fat and in doing so weight would be reduced.[1] This is an intuitive way to look at nutrition and is therefore referenced and used often by the public. However, this way of looking at food and nutrition may lead to a misunderstanding that total calorie intake is the be-all and end-all of nutrition. When in fact, having the right mixture of nutrients and where these nutrients come from is an important aspect of nutrition as well.[2] Fats are extremely calorie dense and satisfaction of caloric requirements can technically be accomplished through consumption of fat alone, but that would certainly cause harm to a human body. Nutrients such as vitamins, carbohydrates, minerals and many more are essential for survival and cannot be accounted for solely through calorie counting. Calorie counting is also inaccurate due to difficulty in accounting for every factor such as calories burnt from sedentary activities, energy used in metabolism and breaking down of food and basal metabolism. (Black box of losing weight through calorie counting. Weight loss categorised into two phases, early phase: \u201crelatively large glycogen, protein, and fluid losses\u201d, late phase: \u201chigh proportion of fat loss\u201d. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810417, without understanding the inner workings of the blackbox, society only cared about the output, ended up with weight loss without loss in fats, leading to short term weight loss.)* Food pyramid In a discussion about balanced diets and nutrition, one cannot not bring up the food pyramid. The first food pyramid was created in Sweden during the 1970s when food prices were high and the food pyramid was supposed to show how to obtain adequate nutrition at affordable prices. Then, Anna Britt Agns\u00e4ter came up with the idea of a triangular diagram to better portray the recommended amounts for each food type. The idea was that there were basic foods which were cheap and nutritious and supplementary foods which provided nutrients missing from the basic foods.[3] However, that version is likely not the one familiar with most people. The most well known version was published by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1992. https://www.fns.usda.gov/food-guide-pyramid-graphic-resources The food pyramid recommends food intake based on research on nutrition balance and daily caloric intake. This is a case where the needs of society gave rise to an increase in interest and funding of research into food and nutrition. This guide encourages a healthy caloric intake with sources of necessary nutrients in the diet. In comparison to relying purely on the calorie concept, the food pyramid provides a much more holistic approach and would be more effective overall in encouraging healthy living. That is not to say the food pyramid created by the USDA is without flaws. A peculiar fact about the 1992 USDA food pyramid is that it has a section dedicated purely to dairy products. The implied message is that dairy products are part of a healthy diet. Yet, humans do not need dairy in their diets.[4] In fact, 68% of the world population have reduced ability to digest lactose, the predominant sugar in milk.[5] Some have speculated that the USDA were subject to pressures from the food industry to include dairy in the pyramid. This is an instance where the effects of societal pressure can be observed in the field of science. Science has often been intertwined with society and in the case of the food pyramid, it is detrimentally so. Reference [1] S. G. Eberle, Endurance sports nutrition, 3rd ed.

"body": "Social Media and its Influence According to Statista, approximately 3.6 billion people globally use social media applications as of January 2020. This is an increase from 3.4 billion people last year, and the number of users is projected to grow even further in the coming years. Number of worldwide social network users After all, digital technologies are expected to become more available and accessible in less developed countries over time. By extension, the number of social media users will also increase. There are many social media applications including, but not limited to, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat. FIX CHART https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/ Globally, governments are instituting varied forms of legislation to counter the potential issues which accompany the proliferation of social media. This is unsurprising given that social media has the power to influence societal norms and behaviours. It could even be argued that social media facilitates co-production. Due to the large reach and influence of social media, it is able to alter and shape identities, institutions, discourses and representations. Therefore, the impact which social media has on society\u2019s conception of food and nutrition is worth analysing. Celebrity Endorsement versus Expert Advice With followers and fans amounting to millions, celebrities and celebrity influencers have an unprecedented amount of influence on people. Due to their fame, celebrities are often perceived as reliable \u201cauthority\u201d. Holmes, S. and Redmond, S. (2012), Framing celebrity: New directions in celebrity culture. Routledge, New York, NY. Consequently, celebrity endorsements which contradict expert advice on issues, including food and nutrition, have detrimental effects which are hard to quantify. An apt example would be Kim Kardashian\u2019s advertisement for appetite suppressant lollipops in May 2018. The Instagram post, as shown below, garnered much backlash before eventually being deleted. https://www.insider.com/kim-karadshian-appetite-suppressant-lollipop-instagram-apology-2018-5 Critics argue that Kim was promoting an unhealthy and toxic culture. According to nutrition editor Cynthia Sass, \u201cwe need healthier relationships with food and our bodies\u201d. Suppressing one\u2019s appetite is definitely not the right approach to achieving weight loss or health. how can this be allow! lollipop ad controversy This highlights a tension between celebrities and experts. While many celebrities benefit from an accelerated growth in the beauty and diet industries, many health experts are struggling as fake news and pseudo-facts are becoming indistinguishable from reliable information. de Regt, A., Montecchi, M., \u0026 Ferguson, S. L. (2019). A false image of health: how fake news and pseudo-facts spread in the health and beauty industry. Journal of Product \u0026 Brand Management. Kim Kardiashian is not the only celebrity guilty of endorsing scientifically questionable products. Teami, a detox tea company that sells various products which allegedly contain health benefits, have been promoted by well-known celebrities including Kylie Jenner, Cardi B and Demi Lovato. Despite having large followings on social media, these celebrities clearly prioritize their personal commercial interests over tangible health implications. In March 2020, Teami was made to pay \\$15 million by the US Federal Trade Commission for \u201cmaking unsubstantiated claims about their products and promoted those claims using paid influencers\u201d. https://www.pedestrian.tv/entertainment/kylie-jenner-jameela-jamil-judgement/ Moreover, experts have warned that excessive or regular consumption of detox teas could damage one\u2019s gut lining, or cause nutrient depletion. https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/skinny-tea-detox-cleansing-instagram-kylie-jenner-laxative-a9080961.html There is clearly a conflict between celebrity endorsements and expert advice. Unfortunately, social media has contributed to the conflict by catapulting celebrities to an unrivalled status, in terms of fame and influence. https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/skinny-tea-detox-cleansing-instagram-kylie-jenner-laxative-a9080961.html Unrealistic Notion of Beauty Social media applications have transformed into a platform which promotes an unrealistic and unhealthy notion of beauty. As highlighted previously, celebrities and influencers profit off others\u2019 self-image insecurities. They routinely go against evidence-based discourse on food and nutrition advocated by experts, choosing instead to promote unreliable health and wellness products. Research has shown that social media usage results in body image concerns amongst both women and men. http://www2.psy.unsw.edu.au/Users/lvartanian/Publications/Fardouly%20\u0026%20Vartanian%20(2016).pdf This can be corroborated by many experts and is an unsurprising finding. After all, social media exposes users to an \u2018ideal\u2019 body type which is often very unrealistic and hard to attain. More often than not, the celebrities and influencers possessing such body types achieve those as a result of routine cosmetic surgeries, expensive diet programmes and even excessive photo editing. In fact, this reasoning forms the basis of Jameela Jamil\u2019s April 2019 criticism of Khloe Kardashian\u2019s Instagram post advertising Flat Tummy shakes. http://www.justjared.com/photo-gallery/4260235/jameela-jamil-slams-khloe-kardashian-01/ In short, an inclusive culture that promotes a healthy concept of food and nutrition is not commonly found in social media platforms. Despite increased efforts by advocates to counter the negative effects which social media has on individuals\u2019 self-image and body image, the overwhelming narrative is still toxic and unhealthy."

We might think it is reasonable to assume that in prehistoric times men simply ate, perhaps in startling patterns of irregularity between starvation and feast. When did men come to tame the world into the lavish, and then stiffing, prison of 3 meals a day, with the caloric concept compelling her how much to eat? \u00bb a typical Singaporean woman would require approximately 1800 kcal a day. There are so many questions in food science that, if I were to be honest with you, cannot be understood with science alone. What is health? Is there a notion of fitness that is independent of gender, poverty lines? What about the dreams of a citizen\u0027s own democratic and free inquiry into this area of scientific interests, which I have spent so much of my life, only to have one paradigm overturned after another? For this reason, I present to you a piecemeal report of my understanding of food. Tell me then, does the food industry nourish us, or do we nourish the food industry more? As any good scientist will warn you: I caution you against believing me naively. Any one in this world is biased in their own way. We resist against this by focusing on the theoretical lens of co-production: that is, the refusal to refuse social issues to science, nor the scientific issues to social determinism."
