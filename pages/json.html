I am an undergraduate majoring in food science with a minor in science, technology and society (\u201cSTS\u201d). I love blogging about social issues in my free time. This blog is about my own reconciliation with the concept of food. What is food? We might think it is reasonable to assume that in prehistoric times, men simply ate, perhaps in startling patterns of irregularity between starvation and feast. When did men come to tame the world into the lavish, and then stiffing, prison of 3 meals a day, with the caloric concept compelling her how much to eat? \u00bb a typical Singaporean woman would require approximately 1800 kcal a day. There are so many questions in food science that, if I were to be honest with you, cannot be understood with science alone. What is health? Is there a notion of fitness that is independent of gender, poverty lines? What about the dreams of a citizen\u0027s own democratic and free inquiry into this area of scientific interests, which I have spent so much of my life, only to have one paradigm overturned after another? For this reason, I present to you a piecemeal report of my understanding of food. Tell me then, does the food industry nourish us, or do we nourish the food industry more?"

This is an object of analysis that occupies my mind day and night: from the very definition of health through the food pyramid, to our personal struggles with diet embedded with the science world via explorations of alternative diets , mental health or beauty. Sheila Jasanoff is a seminal thinker in STS who helped formulate the lens of co-production. Co-production is an idiom of analysis which focuses on the dynamic in which the social and the scientific worlds co-interact and constitute one another. In my writings here, I want to capture the sense in which food science, and its public-facing discourse that has been explicitly shaped by government or industry-sponsored pressures, is continually part of the ordering and reordering of society. Further, rather than focusing on prescribing competing interests to government or industrial forces And thereby give primacy to sociological forces in resolving controversies in science, as my Health Communication courses regularly do. , the theory of co-production instead focuses on specific issues and the reinscribing boundaries between the social and natural worlds. This is what I set out to do as I focus on the difference between an academic food science and food science as the public encounters it. I believe it will be an enlightening experience for all of us. Please leave your comments or talk to me when you see me in school!"

"title": "The Calorie Concept and the Health Pyramid",
"url": "the-calorie-concept-and-the-health-pyramid.html",
"body": "The Calorie Concept The Calorie Concept is based upon the first law of thermodynamics which is the conservation of energy in an isolated system As alluded to in my introduction, from the lens of co-production, the caloric concept and the food pyramid were really the first sites of stabilisation, or in Thomas Kuhn\u2019s language, a paradigm about food science. The idea is that in order to lose weight, a negative caloric balance or caloric deficit is necessary. In a caloric deficit, the body is forced to use energy stored in the body in the form of glycogen and fat and in doing so, weight would be reduced. [1] This is an intuitive way to look at nutrition and is how it is often communicated to, referenced and internalised by the public. The public\u2019s view is that an easy way of losing weight is to eat less, without understanding the nuances of calorie counting and food nutrition. That public discourse stabilizes this naive concept of food nutrition, as opposed to scientists\u2019 closer engagement with nature, is dangerous. It is a misunderstanding that total calorie intake is the be-all and end-all of nutrition. In fact, having the right mixture of nutrients and foods plays as large a part in the physical constitution of our body - our physical self! [2] Food pyramid The food pyramid further represents such a stabilised public understanding about balanced diet and nutrition. The first food pyramid was created in Sweden during the 1970s when food prices were high. It was meant to show people how to obtain adequate nutrition at affordable prices. Then, Anna Britt Agns\u00e4ter came up with the idea of a triangular diagram to better portray the recommended amounts for each food type. The idea was that there were basic foods which were cheap and nutritious and there were supplementary foods which provided nutrients missing from the basic foods. [3] At least for the public\u2019s understanding of food science, it is clear that the Food Pyramid was never a purely scientific instrument, taking into account local societal conditions in the economy and food supply. However, the most well-known version was published by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1992. Source: https://www.fns.usda.gov/food-guide-pyramid-graphic-resources The food pyramid recommends food intake based on research on nutrition balance and daily caloric intake. Further, insofar as nutritional science engages in observational studies of the public\u2019s eating patterns, it is interesting from the lens of co-production that the public\u2019s behaviour is based on the food pyramid. The message from internalising the food pyramid is that a healthy caloric intake consists of different foods of different nutrient profiles. In comparison to relying purely on the calorie concept, the food pyramid provides a much more holistic approach and would be more effective overall in encouraging healthy living. That is not to say the food pyramid created by the USDA is without flaws. A peculiar fact about the 1992 USDA food pyramid is that it has a section dedicated purely to dairy products. The implied message is that dairy products are an essential part of a healthy diet. Yet, humans do not need dairy in their diets. [4] In fact, 68% of the world population have reduced ability to digest lactose, the predominant sugar in milk. [5] Some have speculated that the USDA were subject to pressures from the food industry to include dairy in the pyramid. Powerful and influential actors supported the research of science that benefitted them. A further instance which shows that the food pyramid doesn\u2019t necessarily advance the best scientific advice is that there is a difference between modern and traditional diets, in which foods are more than their constituent ingredients or even nutrients, and this is a complex question showing how processed foods might are worse off than a good traditional (e.g. Mediterranean) meal. Phew! Thanks for reading that. There\u2019s always more to learn on both sides of how society affects an ideal study of food science: after all, most food scientists have the public\u2019s best interests at heart. I\u2019ll discuss this further in my next post about our experimentations with vegetarianism! Reference [1] S. G. Eberle, Endurance sports nutrition, 3rd ed. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 2014.

"title": "Citizen Science and Veganism",
"url": "citizen-science-and-veganism.html",
"body": "What is citizen science? Citizen science is a popularised term that describes a family of different participatory modes in which amateurs, without necessarily a formal training in science, contribute to the production of scientific knowledge (\u201cwith education as an associated goal or a by-product\u201d). [3] Further, there are different types of citizen science such as simple data gathering to extreme forms of citizen science which may include self-experimentation. [4] In today\u2019s post, I would like to discuss how around the globe, the vegetarianism and vegan movement has become more popular. Many individuals are leaning towards plant-based diets due to general health reasons, stemming from concerns over health risk from consuming meat, as well as environmental reasons such as a concern with the environmental degradation associated with the meat industry. In this entry, we focus on vegetarian\u2019s concerns about health, as that is the interface between food science and social actors. Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102038/singapore-reasons-for-plant-based-diets/ Popularity of veganism In 2009, veganism only had a popularity score of 20 in Google\u2019s worldwide search interest ranking. Over the years, veganism\u2019s popularity greatly increased. In 2019, for instance, the popularity score of veganism rose up to 65 in Google\u2019s worldwide search interest ranking. This increased popularity can be attributed to the increased amount of health issues arising from the high levels of consumption of processed foods and red meat over the years. Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44488051 Risk in red meat Consuming red meat would possess higher risk of potential heart disease. According to research from Oxford Academic, people that consume red meat on a regular basis will have a higher level of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). [1] According to a paper in the European Heart Journal, \u201ctrimethylamine N-oxide is a gut microbiota-generated metabolite with mechanistic links to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic heart disease\u201d. [2] Compared to vegans, red meat eaters have three times the amount of TMAO. [2] This revelation plays a role in triggering some people\u2019s change towards plant-based only diets to reduce the risk of potential heart diseases. It is most interesting for our concerns about vegetarianism and citizen science, is that nutritional facts can often be weaponized against polemic enemies, presumably of the opposing diet type. These studies cited by users on these internet forums can range from actual academic papers, or data sets accrued by users on an internet forum. We then question, like Bruno Latour, if these citations are actually properly read and their claims contain a legitimate connection to the scientific actor-network. For instance, a common scientific concern is that vegans can\u2019t get enough vitamin B12, and it might be suggested aggressively or out of concern that vegans ought to eat eggs as well. A view that arguments among citizen scientists parallels disputes among scientists, and their lack of resolution, is interesting, as perhaps it goes in some way to explaining why these problems do not have closure: on a factual, then social level. Food industry Regardless of the tractability of debates about health for or against vegetarianism, the food industry is increasingly positioned to profit from it. Globally, popular fast-food restaurants are aware of the rising trend towards plant-based eating diets. The effects are also evident in Singapore. One prominent example would be McDonald\u2019s release of its first ever veggie burger back in September 2016. The \u2018veggie crunch burger\u2019 was meant to cater to vegans and also individuals opting for a healthier food choice. Such a move to cater to interests in vegetarianism has never been done before on my island state. Source: https://www.travellingmcds.com/2017/05/veggie-crunch-burger-singapore-april.html Singapore\u2019s Burger King outlets also followed McDonald\u2019s footstep. In March 2019, Burger King released a veggie burger and is made available in all Burger King outlets in the country. It was widely advertised on many avenues, including the company\u2019s official Facebook page. Source: https://www.facebook.com/BurgerKingSG/photos/a.403938841773/10157092437906774/?type=3\u0026theater Furthermore, food chains such as Impossible Food have started researching plant-based meat for vegans to experience meat-like taste. This is made possible by an advancing food science with more interests in vegetarianism as a legitimate issue of science and increased funding from societal interest. Source: https://www.impossiblefoods.com/ Plant-based Meat making process video Findings The scientific research on the risk of processed/red meat led to a change in food preference among the citizens to form a vegan movement. It is interesting then, that the shift into vegetarianism out of a concern for red meat, has led to McDonald\u2019s or Burger King\u2019s coalition with vegetarianism, since these processed foods are clearly just as unhealthy, and eating a McDonald\u2019s veggie burger is more of a social signal than a good nutritional source. Further, we have seen that there is an increased stabilisation and interest in food science for vegetarianism as a better health and economical alternative. The changes in society have led scientists to develop/innovate plant-based meat for the vegans which can be seen from Impossible Foods. From my understanding from the co-production\u2019s lens, these dietary battles by scientific and citizen actors will go on for quite a while! Reference [1] Is red meat bad for you?

"title": "Beauty in the Age of Social Media",

"body": "Social Media and its Influence As we are now living in the age of social media, the effect of social media usage on our perception of health and beauty is immense. As of January 2020, approximately 3.6 billion people use social media applications globally. [1] The number of users is projected to grow even further in the coming years! As you can see from the graph below, the most popular social networks garner millions and even billions of users. [2] Isn\u2019t that impressive? Source: Global social networks ranked by number of users With social media\u2019s extensive reach and influence, it is easy to see why social media has become a platform for negotiating between scientific and societal notions of beauty. Individuals are able to easily leverage on social media to alter and shape identities, discourses and representations. Is there a perfect body type? Would it sensible to achieve this ideal and is it made possible by science? The impact of social media on society\u2019s conception of food and nutrition is worth analysing. Celebrity Endorsement versus Expert Advice With followers and fans amounting to millions on social media applications, celebrities and influencers have an unprecedented amount of influence on people. Moreover, celebrities are often perceived as reliable \u201cauthority\u201d. [3] Consequently, celebrity endorsements which contradict expert advice on important matters - including food and nutrition - have detrimental effects which are hard to quantify. An apt example would be Kim Kardashian\u2019s advertisement for appetite suppressant lollipops in May 2018. The Instagram post, as shown below, garnered much backlash before eventually being deleted. [4]. Source: https://www.insider.com/kim-karadshian-appetite-suppressant-lollipop-instagram-apology-2018-5 Health experts and nutritionists critiqued Kardashian for promoting an unhealthy and toxic culture. According to nutrition editor Cynthia Sass, \u201cwe need healthier relationships with food and our bodies\u201d. [5] Suppressing one\u2019s appetite is definitely not the right approach to achieving weight loss or health. This highlights a tension between celebrities and experts. While many celebrities benefit from an unprecedented growth in the beauty and diet industries, many health experts are struggling to keep up as fake news is becoming indistinguishable from reliable information. [6] As a budding food scientist myself, I concur with critiques on this matter. Kardashian is not the only celebrity guilty of endorsing scientifically questionable products. Teami, a detox company, have been promoted by well-known celebrities including Kylie Jenner, Cardi B and Demi Lovato. [7] Teami made a post regarding Kylie Jenner and Cardi B\u2019s endorsements which can be found on the following link: https://www.teamiblends.com/blogs/lifestyle/kylie-jenner-and-cardi-b-endorse-teami Source:https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/skinny-tea-detox-cleansing-instagram-kylie-jenner-laxative-a9080961.html These celebrities are willing to advertise shady products for the sake of commercial interests. Experts have long warned against detox teas as it could damage one\u2019s gut lining or cause nutrient depletion. [8] This turned out to have legal ramifications. In March 2020, Teami was charged \\$15 million by the US Federal Trade Commission for \u201cmaking unsubstantiated claims about their products and promoted those claims using paid influencers\u201d. [9] Once again, we see a conflict between celebrity endorsements and expert advice. Yet, the sheer influence of celebrities means that a potentially large number of individuals could be following toxic and unhealthy methods in hopes of becoming more like these celebrities. Unrealistic Notion of Beauty Research has shown that social media usage results in body image concerns amongst both women and men. [11] This is expected as social media platforms expose users to an \u2018ideal\u2019 body type which is often unrealistic and impossible to attain. Even celebrities and influencers resort to routine cosmetic surgeries, excessive diet programmes, strict gym routines and excessive photo editing to achieve the \u2018desirable\u2019 body. This argument forms the basis of Jameela Jamil\u2019s criticism of Khloe Kardashian\u2019s Instagram post advertising Flat Tummy shakes. [12] Source: http://www.justjared.com/photo-gallery/4260235/jameela-jamil-slams-khloe-kardashian-01/ In short, an inclusive culture that promotes a healthy concept of food and nutrition is not commonly found in social media platforms. Despite increased efforts by advocates to counter the negative effects which social media has on individuals\u2019 self-image and body image, the overwhelming narrative is still toxic and unhealthy. In short, social media platforms have grown to be a site of contestation between well-informed (and often well-intentioned) health experts and corporate-funded celebrities on what constitutes \u2018health\u2019 and \u2018beauty\u2019. There has also been increased efforts to counter the negative effects which social media usage has on individuals\u2019 self-image and body image. Yet, the overwhelming narrative remains toxic and detrimental in the long-run. Worst, it seems impossible to tease the scientific from the social, and it is best for us to continue critically examining the \u2018beautiful\u2019 that bridges the two worlds.

"body": "On bad days, I lie in bed awake at night and an essay flows out of me. The thoughts of technoscience bleed back into the writings of my final year project on NRF-2 and mental health, and then my deranged thoughts bleed back into this thesis. mental health What does it mean to eat anyway? Eating is the main way to provide the required nutrients for one\u2019s nervous system, allowing the body to function optimally. [3] For example, consuming cruciferous vegetables rich in isothiocyanates would allow the body to optimize physiological functions like learning and memory. This compound directly upregulates NRF-2, the gene transcription factor that manages these functions in the brain. However, the inverse is also true. If a subject\u2019s diet contains toxicants which stress their nervous system, it could result in negative mental health results such as hyperactivity in children. However, given a choice, one should opt to eat fresh foods, as the constant consumption of heavily processed foods could lead to further mental health issues like anxiety or depression, due to ingredients such as artificial sweeteners triggering the sudden release of stress hormones. [2] Human bodies are unable to deal with high doses of sugars and the concomitant surges of insulin to manage blood glucose levels. As such, by exposing the body to artificial sweeteners which possess high levels of sugar, such as High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), the human body would release adrenalin to manage this rise in sugar level. Consequently, as adrenalin is an acute stress hormone, it would trigger numerous mental issues such as anxiety and fatigue. A simple lesson to be gleaned is that heavily processed food is unhealthy and should be avoided. But how much is the individual really in control of his own actions? In reality, there are always multiple societal factors that affect the choices made when purchasing and consuming food. Indeed, as displayed in Figure 1 below, the purchase of processed food has increased over the years, which hints at this multi-dimensionality in the act of eating. Again: insofar as sociological factors such as socioeconomic background could be determinants of one\u2019s fate, how much control do we actually have over our actions? Figure 1: Global Changes in Processed foods from foodsource.org.uk One of the major influencers of societal decisions is the factor of cost. The prices of heavily processed foods tend to be comparatively lower than fresh ones, as heavily processed food can be easily produced at a higher rate and are often subsidised by governments. [1] Sadly, as shown in Figure 2 below, the popularity of cheap and heavily processed foods that lack proper nutrients makes it difficult for the poorer members of society to escape from the poverty cycle, as their malnourishment limits their abilities to perform. Consequently, this also highlights the importance of co-production by showing that science and society are not mutually exclusive, as malnutrition can directly result in societal consequences. Figure 2: The Poverty Cycle, from genusixproject.com Generational Impact However, the effects of the lack of nutrition do not simply end there (madness!). Research has shown that this lack of nutrition may have further repercussions as it could affect the offspring of the malnourished. This makes it even harder for families to break out of the poverty cycle. Moreover, a study exploring the effects prenatal nutrition on adult mental health suggests that a lack of proper nutrition would result in an uptick in mental health issues in the population (shown in the Figures below). [1] Scientists attribute the reduction to the normal birth rate, seen in the time period highlighted in Figure 4, The period highlighted coincides with the period when the Netherlands were occupied. to the Dutch famine of 1944 to 1945 and the accompanying lack of proper nutrition. They also added that the lower birth was correlated with a higher incidence of mental health issues, such as schizophrenia, developing as evidenced in Figure 3. Their affected mental health was ultimately caused by the subjects\u2019 parents lack of nutrition and can be attributed to various societal issues. World War II triggered famines due to food rationing, limiting the amount of nutrition received by individuals. This societal issue inevitably caused their children\u2019s mental health to be affected due to malnutrition, as reflected in Figure 3. [1] This relation between famine and the development of mental issues also highlights the importance of co-production, as it reflects how societal issues directly affect scientific/medical ones. Conclusion It can thus be concluded that the effects of nutrition, or most importantly the lack of it, have a direct impact on both the physical and mental health of members of society. It is important that the use of science to assess the effects which food has on society, must not be impervious to socioeconomic factors of the eater. Most importantly, it further cements Jasanoff\u2019s idea of co-production, as they display how science and society are intrinsically tied to each other, as the lack of proper nutrition, due to societal reasons such as poverty, may cost negative consequences, some of which may be long lasting.
